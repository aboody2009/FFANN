# FFANN
09/18/2015
This is an easy to use minimal feed forward artificial neural network library. Setup instructions are in the readme!

In your compiler, use the include folder for the headers, and the lib folder for the libraries
Make sure to link ffann.lib and matrixmath.lib

In your C++ code, include FFANN.h and MatrixMath.h

There is example code in the cpps folder, along with the source code for the libraries in case you want to edit/fix things!

Have fun!
